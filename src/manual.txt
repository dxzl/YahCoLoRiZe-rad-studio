Welcome to 11,08Y07a09hC01o02L03o04R05i06Z07e for 04P05alta01lk/IRC
Chat as well as for creative 13,09WEB DEVEL12OPERS13!

To get started quickly, click the Clients menu and
choose the chat-client you are using. Use the right mouse
button in this window and paste in contents from the clipboard
which you can copy from your internet browser, or fantasy
role-play files, chat-logs, song-lyrics, etc.

(IMPORTANT: The Full power, text-effects and full-spectrum colors
YahCoLoRiZe is capable of only work when you select Trinity
in the Clients menu... most IRC Clients are limited to
16 colors.)

Click the Play menu item and click Options. Here you
can set the text playback speed and the chat-room you want
to send text into.

Press the Process button in the Process tab to format
your text. Processing adds wingdings and borders to the text (if
enabled) and re-arranges it to a particular width. Click the
Show button to convert IRC-Codes text to RTF (Rich-Text)
without actually processing the text.

Now you can play back the color-text into the chat-room by
clicking the 09green Play button. Connect to Paltalk
or IRC and try it! For Paltalk set the BG (background) color to
White! To change the text color, click on the colored-panel that
says "FG" in the Process tab.

If you are creating ASCII art, you need to check the Left
Justify box under the Format tab and also uncheck
Wings. If you are re-rendering an existing ASCII art file,
check Auto (line-width) in the Width tab.

After processing, you can highlight text by left-clicking
and then dragging the mouse over the text. Now go the
Effects menu and choose one of many text-effects such as
alternating the foreground/background colors.

The program SwiftMiX can send song-information to YahCoLoRiZe
which you can then send to your chat room. To use this, run
both SwiftMiX and YahCoLoRiZe. In SwiftMiX, click Send Timing
Telemetry in the Options menu. Load a song and play it. Now
in YahCoLoRiZe right click in the main window and click the
pop-up menu item Process SwiftMiX Song Title.

The song-information will appear in the main window and is
processed automatically. To edit the text, select "Original"
in the View menu. Do your editing and click the Process
button in the Process tab. Now you can play it to a chat-room
by clicking the 09green play button.

(Note: you can edit the SwiftMiX song-format by right-clicking the
file "\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Discrete-Time
Systems\YahCoLoRiZe\colorize.ini" and choose Open With->Notepad.)

You can export the text to a web-page by choosing File
and Export As Web-Page. To copy color-text to e-mail,
simply select the text, right-click Copy then right-click Paste
it into your e-mail.

You can remotely send text to YahCoLoRiZe from your chat-client
by adding a script, alias or plugin (depending on which chat-client
you are using). For help, click Help->Web-Site then click the client
you want help for.

To enter special Unicode characters, type in the 4-digit hex code and
press Alt+X. Example: type 231a followed by Alt+X gives you a watch: âŒš :)

To Uninstall: Go to "Apps and Features", scroll down to YahCoLoRiZe,
click it and select Uninstall.

For additional help, E-Mail: dxzl@live.com or visit my web-site.
