# YahCoLoRiZe-rad-studio
Port of the YahCoLoRiZe IRC-chat color-text processor to Embarcadero RAD Studio C++ Builder Tokyo (Free edition for Windows)

Work in-progress. This port now compiles and major problems have been debugged but I haven't tested many of the program's features and much fine-tuning surely remains. Also, YahCoLoRiZe was originally ANSI only and then I ported it to Unicode the hard way, using an old development environment (Borland C++ Builder 4). When the free version of RAD Studio (Tokyo) came out, I started to port the project but it was fairly daunting. I had to build a new Edit control and scrap the old TaeRichEdit component. the new edit component that goes with YahCoLoRiZe-rad-studio is YcEdit-rad-studio. There are a lot of demo, help, spelling dictionaries and other ancillary files for YahCoLoRiZe that are not included here but are in the old YahCoLoRiZe repository.

Sadly, the finished Embarcadero RAD Studio Tokyo version of YahCoLoRiZe processes text extremely slowly as compared to the old Borland C++ Builder 4. Loops iterating through wchar_t chars are vastly slower for some reason. Is it the compiler? Is it the VCL? Is it just slow because it's the FREE version? But this is ridiculous. The old version of YahCoLoRiZe is much better performance-wise but the new version "looks" a little (not much) newer... So, I suppose this project is finished :-)
